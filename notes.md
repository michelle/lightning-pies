# My year-and-a-half of open source in 10 emoticons

I’m Michelle, and I maintain a WebRTC open source library called PeerJS.

\( ﾟヮﾟ)/
PeerJS!

I have this whole other talk where I explain what PeerJS is and does, but that’s not this one. This one is actually interesting.

How many of you have contributed to open source?

\( ﾟヮﾟ)/ \( ﾟヮﾟ)/

Wow, amazing! Good for you folks.

How many of you want to contribute to open source?

\( ﾟヮﾟ)/ \( ﾟヮﾟ)/ \( ﾟヮﾟ)/


Cool! I did as well, a year and a half ago.

I wanted to party with the cool open source kids. Building silly web apps was no longer fun. I wanted to have street cred.

ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪

But I was too scared to contribute.

(• ε •)

I didn’t feel like I had the domain knowledge to be able to jump into a random project and start helping out.
To be fair to myself, I didn’t even really use any open source projects back then that wasn’t a humungous project like Django or Nodejs.

I felt really really small when reading bugs and seeing all these folks with super duper domain knowledge about networking and APIs and how to best do this or that or that.

(• ε •) (smaller)

So I decided to build my open source library.
I would become a domain master at WebRTC, then a completely new and scary browser technology, and I would make the socketio of WebRTC, since nothing exists yet.

ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

So off I went, and onto launch day. Took me about 2 months to write everything.

ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

Launched on HN, got a pretty positive response and a few hundred stars on the repository.

I eagerly answered all emails that came to our google group, investigated bugs thoroughly and wrote out long replies to everyone who wrote in. And thanked them all for using PeerJS, my amazing library!

And in March 2013, PeerJS hit 1000 stars!

I was estatic! I could finally party with the cool kids

But then I saw this tweet:

(╥﹏╥)

It was like I’d been flipped on my back.

(╯°Д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \)

My spirits fell. I thought to myself, ...if only stars were actually a signifier of how good an open source library is! Then I would’ve really made it in life. But they’re not. My library is buggy and lacks all the features and I can’t believe people actually use it.

The emails then seemingly got more angry. X isn’t working. Y edge case isn’t working. Z doesn’t work in this particular combination.

And my answer changed from this:

ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

to this:

¯\(º_o)/¯
Iono.

then, this:

꒰ ꒡⌓꒡꒱
Can’t repro; won’t fix.

It became a chore to keep up my “domain knowledge” of WebRTC, or at least I treated it as such. It wasn’t a product I even used myself, and peer to peer networking was not a topic I was particularly passionate about.

꒰ ꒡⌓꒡꒱
This library isn’t meant for that level of abstraction.

꒰ ꒡⌓꒡꒱
you should manage ids yourself.

꒰ ꒡⌓꒡꒱
If you want to do that, you should just run your own servers.

these are fair answers. These are answers I see other maintainers giving their users. But it made me sad to give them.

While I was excited to solve every issue and make the library better before, I now found myself helplessly annoyed every time a new email came in, because most of the time it was someone doign something wrong. And little thigns like writing guides I had to do myself.

(• ε •)

Why don’t people help?

¯\(º_o)/¯
why won’t anyone help me?

Well, I thought, probably because there are no tests.

But do I write tests or fix bugs or answer emails in the 2 hours a week that I actually have time to sit down and work on this?

I end up doing all those things crappily.

(╥﹏╥)




But I really do want to help people. I really do want to make my library a success.

And despite all the emails and frustration, it’s rewarding. The little things you are able to find time to do for folks become:

“Michelle, thank you so much, you are a life saver.”

ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪ ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

And then those moments when actual Real Companies like NTT and Bitpay contact you and want to use your library--that’s pretty amazing.

A few weeks ago I was having coffee with a reporter who was interested in WebRTC when I had a belated epiphany about open source.

He asked me if I’d heard of so-and-so WebRTC project that’s been around since 2 years ago. I said no.

¯\(º_o)/¯
Iono

He then said, “Wow, really? Everyone knows about that one.” Then he asks about some other WebRTC project that’s been in the news lately.

¯\(º_o)/¯
Iono

At this point, it was pretty obvious that he’d lost confidence in my knowledge of the topic.

And that’s when I had the epiphany. It didn’t bother me that he did. A year ago, I would’ve been again thrown on my back, and tried my best to learn about all the things and catch up and be miserable.

(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \)

But now, I realize that I maintain peerjs not because I’m a domain expert on WebRTC or because I want to be, but because I think it’s cool technology, and I want to help people who want to build on it.

Remember my question from earlier?


¯\(º_o)/¯
Why won’t anyone help me?

The answer is probably because they don’t feel like they have the domain knowledge to contribute.

This is the same feeling I had when looking at Django, Nodejs, etc etc. the feeling of being very small and unknowledgable.

But what they don’t realize is that I know just as little as them. For most questions I’m asked, I google things. I make things up and say it loudly enough that people believe me. I read code. I console.log debug.

We’re all in the same boat.


and I’m realizing this more and more as I’m contributing to various rework css plugins and our stripe client libraries--the folks building rework plugins are not the domain experts on css media queries or css parsing or css colors. they’re just people who know how to code and who use these tools and want to help others who want to use these tools.

Open source is really more of a community than a group of domain experts building infallable software.VyV

“Do we need a bigger boat?”

In fact, back when I maintained stripe-php, I’d never even written PHP before. Which is arguably a bit of a stretch--but that’s the extent to which you can not have domain knowledge and still contribute to open source.


And as a final thought...
I think this tweet is wrong.

Github stars do matter :). They’re good karma.

PeerJS!
